# <a name="">Reading books in the Safari O'Reilly library from off campus, with your UCSD login

Above, are various URLs for books in the Safari O'Reilly library.

You can read these for free from on campus, (provided no more than 30 users in the entire UC system are accessing the library.)

If you are off campus, though, you either won't be able to see the full content, OR, you might be asked to create  a personal account which requires a credit card.    

Here is how you get aroud that.
* Navigate to: https://vpn-2.ucsd.edu/ and login with your UCSD username and password 
* Paste the URL for the bookabove into the box that looks like this: ![/images/VPN.url.bar.png](/images/VPN.url.bar.png)
